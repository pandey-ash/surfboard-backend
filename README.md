# surfboard-backend

It's a backend for the Surfboard coding challenge that's built with the **spring boot** framework and uses the **JPA** framework for ORM.
**Spring security** is used to secure this web project using basic authentication. The user's password is **BCrypt encoded with salt**, so neither the Sysadmin nor the developer has access to it.
The data is stored in the **MySQL** database.
